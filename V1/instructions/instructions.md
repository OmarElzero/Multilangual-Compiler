# PolyRun: Mixed-Language Code Execution Engine

## 🎯 Project Goal
Create a platform that allows developers to write code in multiple programming languages within a single file (`.mix`) and execute it seamlessly. Over time, the project will evolve into a full-featured compiler toolchain that supports parsing, validating, executing, and linking code across languages.

## ✅ Phase 1: CLI MVP – Parser + Mixed Runner

### Goal
Build a command-line tool that parses `.mix` files with multiple code blocks and executes each one.

### Tasks
- Set up project folder structure
- Write parser to detect `#lang:...` blocks
- Write simple runners for Python and C++
- Create `main.py` to orchestrate execution
- Add configuration file support for default settings
- Implement input validation for `.mix` file format
- Enhanced error reporting with line numbers and context
- Structured logging system instead of simple file writes

### Time Estimate
**1–2 days**

---

## 🧪 Phase 1.5: Testing & Validation

### Goal
Implement comprehensive testing and validation for the core functionality.

### Tasks
- Unit tests for parser module
- Integration tests for language runners
- Test suite for error handling scenarios
- Validation tests for `.mix` file format
- Performance benchmarking setup

### Time Estimate
**1 day**

---

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Output Handling + Error Support

### Goal
Capture output and errors cleanly, format them per language.

### Tasks
- Capture stdout, stderr, return codes
- Print formatted output for each block
- Save logs in `/output/` folder
- Implement structured logging with timestamps
- Add execution time tracking and memory usage monitoring
- Enhanced error messages with suggestions

### Time Estimate
**1–2 days**

---

## 📊 Phase 2.5: Performance Monitoring

### Goal
Add performance tracking and optimization capabilities.

### Tasks
- Execution time measurement per code block
- Memory usage tracking
- Performance comparison between runs
- Optimization suggestions based on metrics
- Resource usage reporting

### Time Estimate
**1 day**

---

## 🔐 Phase 3: Sandbox Execution (Security)

### Goal
Prevent malicious or infinite code from harming the system.

### Tasks
- Add execution timeouts and limits
- Use Docker to isolate execution
- Clean up containers after run
- Implement resource quotas (CPU, memory, disk)
- Add security policies and access controls
- Container image optimization for faster startup

### Time Estimate
**2–3 days**

---

## 🌍 Phase 4: Multi-Language + Data Linking

### Goal
Add more languages and allow variable passing across them.

### Tasks
- Add runners for JavaScript, Bash, Java
- Use temp files or env to pass data
- Update parser for `#export` / `#import` tags
- Implement plugin architecture for language runners
- Add caching system for compiled binaries
- Support for language-specific dependency management

### Time Estimate
**3–5 days**

---

## 🌐 Phase 5: Web Interface (UI + API)

### Goal
Build a web-based UI for writing and running `.mix` code.

### Tasks
- React + Monaco Editor for frontend
- FastAPI or Flask backend with `/run` endpoint
- Deploy frontend/backend
- Add syntax highlighting for `.mix` files
- Implement progress indicators for long-running code
- Real-time execution output streaming

## 📋 Technical Specifications

### `.mix` File Format
```
#lang:python
print("Hello from Python!")

#lang:cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello from C++!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

#lang:javascript
console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");

#export:variable_name
// Export data to be used by other blocks

#import:variable_name
// Import data from previous blocks
```

### API Contracts
All language runners must return:
```json
{
    "success": boolean,
    "output": string,
    "error": string,
    "execution_time": float,
    "memory_used": int,
    "exit_code": int
}
```

### Configuration File (config.json)
```json
{
    "default_timeout": 30,
    "max_memory": "512MB",
    "supported_languages": ["python", "cpp", "javascript", "bash"],
    "docker_enabled": true,
    "log_level": "INFO",
    "output_directory": "./output"
}
```
